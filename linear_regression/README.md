# Linear Regression model

## Description:


The code applies gradient descent algorithm ,assume initial values for 
weights and bias , calculate y and then optimize the parameters to reduce the cost function , learning rate it update to be smaller if cost is getting higher. I assumed termination will be when cost function is almost constant it can be also done through specific number of iterations.
Data is normalized if the dataset is multivariate .
Evaluating performance used mean square error metric calculating error.
